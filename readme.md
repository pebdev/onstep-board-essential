## Description

[OnStep](https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki) is an open source project to control a telescope mount (goto). 

Essential board is an hardware solution which use OnStep with the essential parts only :

- ESP32 to run OnStep
- 3 axis controller (DE, RA and focuser)
- GPS (time and location)
- Humidity, barometric pressure and ambient temperature sensors

**This project provides :**

- Design of the Essential board
- Updated OnStep project for this board

**Main components :**

- (x1) **Essential board** (this project)

## Hardware change

ESP32 board has a big defect, it resets when a serial connection is opened, caused by RTS (Ready To Send) if it's enabled.

For this reason, a patch must be applied.

## Fetch project

Be sure that you have the Essential branch of OnStep :

  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  git checkout board-essential-v1
  ```



## Installation

### Xcode
Because we use tools provided with Xcode, install it from the AppleStore.
When it's done start it and install proposed tool.

sudo xcode-select --reset
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

### ESP32 board support

This project use ARDUINO environment, install it before to start and follow these steps :

**1-** Open **OnStep.ino** file from Arduino application

**2-** Add ESP32 board support to Arduino :

- Select *Arduino > Preferences* "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
  - add: **https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json**
- Install support for this board from within the menu *Tools > Board > Boards Manager*
  - Seach for esp32 and install the version **1.0.4 only**

**3-** Select ESP32 board for the project :

- Tools > Board Type > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32 Dev Module



### Libraries

#### TinyGPSPlus

**1-** Download sources from github : [link](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

**2-** Install it with Arduino GUI :

- Sketch > Include Library > Add .zip Library ...
- Select the zip file (or folder because OSX unzip it after downloading)
- Now you can delete zip file or folder

#### Adafruit BMP280 Library

**1-** Install it with Arduino GUI :

- Tools > Manage Libraries
- Install Adafruit BMP280 Library



## Build

Nothing special, just build the code.

If you have this error when you build OnStep :

```
ValueError: dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, kIOMasterPortDefault): symbol not found
```

Follow these steps :

1- Install **python3 (3.10)** with MacPorts (or Homebrew, etc)
```
sudo port install python310
```

2- Install **pip** tool
```
sudo port install py310-pip
```

3- Install **pyserial** package :

```
python -m pip install pyserial
```

3- Update esptool :

```
cd ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/2.6.1
mv esptool esptool.orig
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/esptool/master/esptool.py -o esptool
chmod +x esptool
```

If you still get the same `symbol not found` error then open **esptool** and change the first line from `#!/usr/bin/env python` to `#!/usr/local/bin/python3`.

or 

`sed -i -e 's/=python /=python3 /g' ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/*/platform.txt`


## How to flash the board

According the ESP32 hardware patch that we applied, it's mandatory to follow these steps to reflash the board :

## Validation

This project was tested with these parts :

- Bresser EQ3 mount, with custom goto addon : [stl files](https://cults3d.com/fr/mod√®le-3d/divers/bresser-eq3-motor-addon)
- Telescope application (OSX)

A simple way to test if OnStep is alive on the board, use a serial terminal and enter this command :

```
:GVP#
```

All commands of OnStep can be found [here](https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki/23755).



## Customization ##

According your mount, you must change values of your gear ratios.

**1-** Use this [excel sheet](https://baheyeldin.com/sites/baheyeldin.com/files/OnStep-Calculations.xls) to calculate data for your mount

**2-** Update these defines into the **config.h** file in the Arduino project
